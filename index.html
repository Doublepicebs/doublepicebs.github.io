    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>
      I am your average Egyptian high school nerd. I love programming, although I suck at it :)
    </p>
    <p>
      I started programming in 2019.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fun Fact: I don't have a PC. I can't afford it. This entire webpage and all my projects are made with <a href="https://spck.io">spck editor</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tech.ula">UserLAnd</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Skills</h3>
    <p>
      I know some ruby, lua, css and js. I don't really like wroking with node.js, I try to keep everything as vanilla as possible.
    </p>

      Currently, there is nothing worth showing. (◡ ω ◡)
